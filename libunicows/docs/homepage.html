<h3>What is libunicows?</h3>

Traditionally, win32 Unicode API was only available on Windows NT or 2000. If you wanted
to take advantage of Unicode in your application and support Windows 95/98 at the same
time, your only option was to deploy two executables, one for NT and one for 9X. 
Fortunately, this changed in 2001 when MS (finally!) released MSLU runtime that
allows Unicode applications to run under Windows 9X.
<p>

See these pages for details:

</ul>

<p>
Less fortunately, this solution requires that you use a special statically linked
import library that decides at runtime whether to load symbols from system libraries
like kernel32.dll or user32.dll (in case of Windows NT) or from unicows.dll (which
provides Unicode emulation layer under 9X). This import library is only available
for Microsoft Visual C++ and is only part of the new Platform SDK, which is rather
huge package.

<p>
libunicows contains independent implementation of the import library. It can be
used with any C compiler (although it was only tested with Mingw32 and MSVC so far)
and is released under the Open Source
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a>
(this permits you to link the library into your executable without any restrictions).



<h3>Help needed!</h3>

Currently only Mingw32 and MSVC are supported. In order to provide precompiled libraries
for as many compilers as possible, your help is needed! I'd like to have libraries
and makefiles for at least Watcom and Borland compilers.
