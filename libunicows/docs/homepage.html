<h3>What is libunicows?</h3>

Traditionally, win32 Unicode API was only available on Windows NT or 2000. If
you wanted to take advantage of Unicode in your application and support Windows
95/98 at the same time, your only option was to deploy two executables, one for
NT and one for 9X.

Fortunately, this changed in 2001 when MS (finally!) released MSLU runtime that
allows Unicode applications to run under Windows 9X.
<p>

</ul>

<p>
Less fortunately, this solution requires that you use a special statically
linked import library that decides at runtime whether to load symbols from
system libraries like kernel32.dll or user32.dll (in case of Windows NT) or
from unicows.dll (which provides Unicode emulation layer under 9X). This import
library is only available for Microsoft Visual C++ and is only part of the new
Platform SDK, which is rather huge package.

<p>
libunicows contains independent implementation of the import library. It can be
used with any C compiler (although it was only tested with Mingw32 and MSVC so
far) and is released under the Open Source
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a>
(this permits you to link the library into your executable without any
restrictions).

<p>
For compilers where "native" import library is not available in precompiled
form or is impossible/difficult to create (this is the case of e.g. Borland C++
which doesn't use COFF libraries), libunicows 
provides alternative mean of using unicows.dll (beginning with version 0.6).
There is a version of unicows
import library compiled as a DLL, called <i>unicows_wrapper.dll</i>. You can
create import library for the wrapper as you do with any other DLL and calls
to Unicode API functions will go through the wrapper DLL. Unlike when
creating such import library for unicows.dll, unicows.dll is <em>not</em>
used on NT/2000/XP systems when using the wrapper.


<h3>Help needed!</h3>

Currently only Mingw32 and MSVC are directly supported.
In order to provide precompiled
libraries for as many compilers as possible, your help is needed! I'd like to
have libraries and makefiles for at least Watcom and Borland compilers
(note that Borland support is nontrivial do to its object files format -
I wasn't able to figure it out, but hopefully some expert can help here!).
